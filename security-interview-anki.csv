"What is a three-way handshake?";"The three-way handshake is a process used by TCP to establish a connection between a client and server through three steps: 1) SYN: Client sends SYN packet with initial sequence number, 2) SYN-ACK: Server acknowledges and sends its own sequence number, 3) ACK: Client acknowledges server's sequence number. Security implications include vulnerability to SYN flood attacks, TCP sequence prediction attacks, and importance for stateful firewall operation.";"Encryption and Authentication"
"How do cookies work?";"Cookies are small text files stored on a client's browser that contain data sent from a website. When a user visits a site, the server can send cookies via HTTP response headers. The browser stores these and sends them back with subsequent requests to the same domain. Cookies enable session management, personalization, and tracking. Security concerns include: cookie theft through XSS, CSRF attacks, privacy leakage if not properly secured with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite flags.";"Encryption and Authentication"
"How would you secure a Kubernetes cluster?";"Securing a Kubernetes cluster requires a defense-in-depth approach including: 1) Cluster configuration security with TLS encryption, RBAC implementation, API server protection, and etcd security, 2) Node/container hardening with minimal images, non-root users, and Pod Security Standards, 3) Network security with policies and service mesh, 4) Secrets management using encryption and external solutions, 5) Continuous monitoring and runtime threat detection, 6) Regular updates and security audits. Key tools include kube-bench, Falco, Trivy, OPA/Gatekeeper, and proper logging solutions.";"Containers and Cloud Security"
